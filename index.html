                <h3>No-Bake Lemon Icebox Pie</h3>
                <p>"This pie is delicious!!! My guest were not able to show up when I made the pie, my mom and each enjoyed a small piece.  Since the recipe says not to refrigerate more than eight hours I figured I had nothing to lose, so I put it in the freezer and took it to work the next day. Five of us enjoyed it while partially frozen, everyone to include myself thought it was great!!! Everyone loved the crust, so glad I took the the time to make a crust rather than using store bought like I usually do.  By the way it was 110 degrees today where I live, so a perfect dessert!!!"</p>

                <h3>Classic Blueberry Pie</h3>
                <p>"Best blueberry pie ever! I made the filling with fresh, frozen wild Maine blueberries, thickened with corn starch, reduced sugar to 1/3 cup and added lemon zest instead of juice. Mix frozen blueberries with sugar, cornstarch and cinnamon and let sit for 15 minutes. When berries begin to absorb dry ingredients, add lemon zest, assemble the pie and bake. Brush egg white over the top crust and sprinkle sugar before baking. My whole family loved it. Delish with vanilla ice cream."</p>

                <h3>Peach Crumble Pie</h3>
                <p>"I made this pie for a peach festival and I was a little nervouse because there was going to be tough competition. It was fantastic! Super easy to make and it looked different from the other pies so it caught people's attention (which is what i wanted with the judges). We bought more peaches at the festival and made another one that day!"</p>

                <h3>Scrumptious Apple Pie</h3>
                <p>"This was my first apply pie and it was amazing! Peeling of the apples and making the crust was time consuming, but I was searching for a good recipe that would start from scratch. I will continue to make this again and again. When going through the steps, when it said make into small rounds, I flattened it with a rolling pin to make the shells. I suppose I wasn't supposed to do that until after it had been refrigerated. I'm glad I did though. When I took the dough out it just seemed to fall apart into a million pieces if you weren't careful. My crust was still incredibly flaky."</p>
